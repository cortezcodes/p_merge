# pMerge

This program takes the commonly used PDFMerge software and adds a Tkinter GUI to it to make it more user friendlly for your none command-line co-workers.

##Motivation
This project is my first attempt at programming in over 2 years. I graduated with a BS in Computer Science and went straight into Military Service as a Marine Pilot. At work, we deal with a lot of paperwork (surprise, surprise, pilots have desk jobs too) and though I know how to use python scripts to manipulate PDF files most of my co-workers do not. So to help with office productivity, and to knock off some rust on my programming skills, I began this repository.

I am using a MVC pattern to separate the logic from the GUI. Like I said this is my first project on github so as of 9 March 2019 expect very basic functionality. 

Functions:
Currently the p_controller.py
